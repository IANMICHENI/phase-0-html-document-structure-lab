### Phase-3-SQLAlchemy-Code-Challenge-Restaurants

## AUTHOR
** Ian Mwenda **

## DESCRIPTION
In this code challenge, we'll be working with a restaurant review domain, implementing SQLAlchemy migrations, relationships, and querying. The project involves three models: Restaurant, Review, and Customer. A Restaurant has many Reviews, a Customer has many Reviews, and a Review belongs to both a Restaurant and a Customer. The relationship between Restaurant and Customer is a many-to-many relationship.

## INSTRUCTIONS
Build the methods listed in the deliverables section. Though the suggested order is provided, feel free to tackle the methods in an order you find appropriate. Some methods depend on others, so be cautious.

Note: This code challenge does not include tests, so running pytest won't work. You need to create your own sample instances and test your code in the console.

Create sample data using the seeds.py file to test your models and relationships. Prioritize writing methods that work and test your code in the console.

## SETTING UP
1. Migrations and Models: Create migrations for the initial Restaurant and Customer models. Seed data for some Restaurants and Customers.

2.  Reviews Table: Create a migration for the reviews table with the necessary columns, including star_rating.

3.    Sample Data: Use the seeds.py file to create instances of all your classes for testing.
